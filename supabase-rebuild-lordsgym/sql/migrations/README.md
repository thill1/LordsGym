# Migrations

Migrations are applied from **LordsGym/supabase/migrations/**.

This folder is for reference or local copies. Do not duplicate migrations here; use the LordsGym repo as source of truth.

To apply migrations: from LordsGym root, run `npm run db:push` after linking to the target project via `npx supabase link --project-ref <TARGET_PROJECT_REF>`.
