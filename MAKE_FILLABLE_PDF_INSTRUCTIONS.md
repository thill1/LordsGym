# How to Make the PDF Fillable

## Option 1: Use Adobe Acrobat Pro (Best for True Fillable PDF) ✅

1. Open `CLIENT_UAT_PLAN.pdf` in Adobe Acrobat Pro (not Reader)
2. Go to **Tools** → **Prepare Form**
3. Acrobat will auto-detect form fields (checkboxes, text fields)
4. Review and adjust form fields as needed
5. Click **File** → **Save As** → **PDF**
6. The PDF is now fillable - clients can fill it out and save

**Note:** Adobe Acrobat Pro is a paid software. If you don't have it, use Option 2.

## Option 2: Use the HTML Form (Recommended - Already Fillable!) 🌐

The HTML form (`CLIENT_UAT_PLAN.html`) is **already fully fillable**!

**Instructions for Client:**
1. Open `CLIENT_UAT_PLAN.html` in any web browser
2. Fill out all checkboxes and form fields
3. Click the **"Print / Save as PDF"** button
4. In the print dialog, select **"Save as PDF"** or **"Microsoft Print to PDF"**
5. Save the file
6. Email the completed PDF back

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Already works - no additional software needed
- ✅ Works on any device (Windows, Mac, tablet, phone)
- ✅ No Adobe Acrobat Pro required
- ✅ Form fields are interactive
- ✅ Can be filled on mobile devices
