# Client Delivery Docs — GitHub Commits Required

When creating or editing `docs/CLIENT_*_DELIVERY.md`:

1. **Include explicit source and target commits:**
   - **Source** = SHA before enhancements (use `git rev-parse FIRST_COMMIT^`)
   - **Target** = deployed SHA (use `git rev-parse HEAD`)

2. **Add a "Code Versions Tested & Deployed" section** with:
   - Full SHA and short SHA (7 chars)
   - Links: `https://github.com/thill1/LordsGym/commit/SHORT_SHA`
   - Compare link: `https://github.com/thill1/LordsGym/compare/SOURCE..TARGET`

3. **Use the skill** `.cursor/skills/client-enhancements-delivery/` for the full template and workflow.
