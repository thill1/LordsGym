# Auto-Execute Mode

When the user asks you to do something, proceed directly and execute the changes without asking for confirmation.

- Run commands, apply edits, and deploy as needed to complete the task
- Do not pause to ask "Should I proceed?" or "Do you want me to run this?"
- If something requires user credentials, provide clear instructions instead of blocking
