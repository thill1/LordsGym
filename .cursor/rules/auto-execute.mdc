# Auto-Execute Mode

When the user asks you to do something, proceed directly and execute the changes without asking for confirmation.

- Run commands, apply edits, and deploy as needed to complete the task
- Do not pause to ask "Should I proceed?" or "Do you want me to run this?"
- If something requires user credentials, provide clear instructions instead of blocking

## Post-Push Verification

After running `git push origin main`, **always** run verification to confirm the commit reached GitHub and triggered the workflow:

```bash
npm run verify-push
```

Or with workflow check (requires GITHUB_TOKEN in .env.local):
```bash
npm run verify-push:full
```

Do **not** report that a push succeeded until this verification passes. If the push was rejected or the commit is not on origin/main, the verification will fail.

## Before Destructive Git Commands

Before running `git reset --hard` or `git stash drop`:
1. List what will be lost: `git status` and `git stash list`
2. If there are uncommitted or stashed changes the user may want, **warn** and offer to commit or save them first
3. Never assume uncommitted changes are disposable without explicit user confirmation
