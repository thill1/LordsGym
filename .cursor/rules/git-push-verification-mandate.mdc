# Git Push Verification Mandate

**This process is mandatory. Changes require user approval.**

## After Every Git Push

1. Run `npm run verify-push` (or `npm run verify-push:full`) to confirm the commit matches what was pushed.
2. Verify the commit is the tip of `origin/main` and that a workflow run was triggered for that commit.
3. Do **not** report that a push succeeded until verification passes.

## Deviation Handling

- **Any deviation** (push rejected, commit not on remote, workflow not triggered, mismatch) must be **communicated to the user immediately**.
- Drift must be **mediated** — do not proceed as if the push succeeded. Resolve or escalate.
- Do not assume or silently work around verification failures.

## Changes to This Process

- Any modification to this verification process, the verify-push script, or these rules **requires user approval** before implementation.
- Do not alter, relax, or bypass this mandate without explicit user consent.
